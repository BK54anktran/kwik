/**
 * Registry of this endpoint's connection IDs. The peer uses these connection IDs as destination connection IDs.
 * This endpoint issues these connection IDs (initially, by set the source connection ID in the long header packets and
 * after the handshake by sending NewConnectionId frames), but the peer determines which connection ID to use: it can
 * use any active (not retired) connection ID at any time. Hence, there is no notion of a "current" connection ID.
 * Only during the handshake, the connection ID is fixed (except for a server using preferred address).
 *
 * https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-5.1
 * "Each connection possesses a set of connection identifiers, or connection IDs, each of which can identify the
 *  connection. Connection IDs are independently selected by endpoints; each endpoint selects the connection IDs that
 *  its peer uses."
 *  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-5.1.1
 *  "The initial connection ID issued by an endpoint is sent in the Source Connection ID field of the long packet
 *   header (Section 17.2) during the handshake. The sequence number of the initial connection ID is 0. If the
 *   preferred_address transport parameter is sent, the sequence number of the supplied connection ID is 1."
 *  "Connection IDs that are issued and not retired are considered active; any active connection ID is valid for use
 *   with the current connection at any time, in any packet type. "
