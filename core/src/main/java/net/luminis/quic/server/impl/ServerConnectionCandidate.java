/**
 * A server connection candidate: whether an initial packet causes a new server connection to be created will not be
 * decided until the initial packet has been successfully parsed and decrypted (to avoid that corrupt packets change
 * server state).
 *
 * <p>
 * When an initial packet with an unknown destination connection ID arrives, a ServerConnectionCandidate is created,
 * to avoid that ServerConnection objects are create for invalid packets. However, this candidate is registered in the
 * ServerConnectionRegistry, because additional initial packets with the same destination connection ID might arrive, even
 * while still processing the first, and obviously these should not lead to another ServerConnectionCandidate being created,
 * but must be delivered to the same connection (even if still a candidate).
 * Note that this candidate is registered with the original destination connection ID and that only _initial_ packets with
 * this connection ID are allowed, hence the InitialPacketFilterProxy.
 * If additional initial packets with the original destination connection ID arrive, the server candidate will pass
 * them through to the final connection.
 * If the initial packet did not lead to a server connection, the entry with the ODCID will be removed after some time. </o>
 * <p>
 * Now the connection candidate will parse the initial packet, but on a different thread (to limit usage of the thread that
 * is receiving UDP datagrams). If the packet is valid, the candidate creates the final connection and registers this in
 * the ServerConnectionRegistry, but with the new connection ID that is generated by the server connection itself.
 * The server connection is wrapped by a ServerConnectionThread (to ensure that minimal processing is done on the receiver
 * thread and that all processing for a server connection is done on the same thread (to enable thread-confinement strategy))
 * and by a filter chain that does a lot of processing before the packet is delivered to the connection. </p>
 * <p>
 * So, effectively, for each connection the registry will contain:
 * <pre>
 * - ODCID -> InitialPacketFilterProxy -> ServerConnectionCandidate [ -> filter-chain -> adapter -> ServerConnectionThread -> ServerConnectionImpl ]
 * -   CID -> ServerConnectionWrapper -> filter-chain -> adapter -> ServerConnectionThread -> ServerConnectionImpl
 *                                     \- - - - - - - - - - - - -/
 * </pre>
 * When new connection IDs are sent to the peer, additional entries will be added to the registry to ensure these new
 * connection IDs also map to the same connection. </p>
