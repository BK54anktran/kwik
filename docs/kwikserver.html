    <h1>Welcome to Kwik & Flupke!</h1>
    <h2>The open source QUIC (and HTTP/3) server written entirely in Java!</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pjtr/kwik/src/master/">Kwik</a> started as a Java QUIC client library and command line application.
        Today, the Kwik client is a rather mature implementation of the QUIC protocol, and includes features like connection migration, 0-RTT and key update.
        Interoperability with 13 server implementations is tested daily, see <a href="https://interop.seemann.io/">automated interoperability tests</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The QUIC protocol is defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html">RFC 9000</a>.
        Kwik also supports the last IETF draft versions (draft-29 to draft-32, draft-33 and draft-34 are not supposed to be deployed).
    </p>
    <p>
        Development of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pjtr/kwik/commits/">Kwik server</a> started in November 2020.
        It is still work in progress, but basic functionality works fine, which is proven by the fact that you are currently reading a resource that was served by Kwik.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTTP/3 support is implemented by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pjtr/flupke/src">Flupke</a>, a library written on top of Kwik.
        Flupke implements the basic HTTP methods and uses a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pjtr/qpack/src/master/">QPack</a> implementation
        that doesn't use dynamic compression (i.e. it does not use dynamic table; static table is of course supported, it wouldn't work without).
    </p>

        Kwik and Flupke are created an maintained by Peter Doornbosch. Logo's by Piet van Dongen. For questions, see
        the contact information in the readme's of the bitbucket repositories.
